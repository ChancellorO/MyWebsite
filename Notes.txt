Steps on how to create your own website

#1 INITIALIZING THE REPOSITORY
First create a "app.js" file within the directory
This file will start the website

Next configure the package.json, to do so run
`npm init` 
In the Terminal in respect to the Website's directory

Next we must install the dependencies, for my application I will be using express, dotenv, ejs, mongoose, and nodemon.
`npm install express ejs nodemon mongoose dotenv`

You will notice a directory "node_modules" will appear. This is a directory where all of npm packages are stored and referrenced. 

For clarification, npm stands for "node package manager", which directly works with nodejs, given the name.

#2 DISPLAYING YOUR FIRST PAGE 
For this project, I've chose to use ejs as a way to manage and display my html files, so I have created a views directory
as well as the "MainPage.ejs" file
